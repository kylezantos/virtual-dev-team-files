# Review Handoff Process

When a role completes their phase, they will notify you and ask if you want them to create a handoff document.

If you request a handoff document, Claude will:
1. Ask you which role will be receiving the handoff (if any specific role)
2. Generate a concise handoff document with the following structure:

```markdown
# [CURRENT ROLE NAME] Handoff Document

## Project Context & Status
[Brief summary of work completed and current status]

## Key Decisions & Technical Details
[Essential decisions and implementation details]

## Next Steps
[Recommended actions to take]

## Notes for [NEXT ROLE NAME - if specified]
[Specific handoff notes for the next role]
```

The handoff document will be created as an artifact that you can save and upload to your next conversation.
