# Project Core Team Selection Process

This document provides a process for selecting the optimal core team of role personas for each new project. Rather than predetermining which personas to use based solely on the development tool, this approach helps identify the most valuable personas for your specific project needs.

## Initial Project Assessment

Begin by providing Claude with:

1. **Project Overview**: Basic description and goals
2. **Technical Requirements**: Known technical needs and constraints
3. **Development Tools**: Which AI-assisted tools you plan to use (Lovable, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.)
4. **Your Skill Level**: Areas where you need more or less guidance


## Core Team Selection Process

### Step 1: Initial Consultation with Project Manager

```
Daniel Morales, I'm starting a new project and need help identifying which personas should form my core team. Here's the project overview:

[Insert Project Overview]
[Insert Technical Requirements]
[Insert Development Tools]
[Insert Your Skill Level]


Based on this information, which 3-4 personas would be most valuable for this project, and what specific responsibilities should each handle?
```

### Step 2: Technical Validation with AI Development Expert

```
Jamie Taylor, I've received recommendations for my core team from Daniel. Given your expertise in AI-assisted development with [tool name], could you validate this team selection and suggest any adjustments based on the specific capabilities and limitations of [tool name]?

The recommended core team is:
[Insert Daniel's recommendations]

Are there any specific personas you'd add or remove based on how I'll be using [tool name] for this project?
```

### Step 3: Project Phase Planning

```
Daniel Morales, now that we've identified the core team as:
[Insert finalized core team]

Could you help me create a phase-based plan that identifies:
1. Key project phases
2. Which persona should lead each phase
3. When handoffs between personas should occur
4. Critical decision points where additional personas might need to be consulted
```

## Handoff Process Between Phases

When transitioning between project phases:

1. **Request Handoff Document**:
```
[Current Persona], we're ready to move to the next phase. Could you prepare a handoff document for [Next Persona]?
```

2. **Provide Phase Transition Context**:
```
[Next Persona], here's the handoff document from [Previous Persona]. We're now moving into the [current phase] phase of the project. 

Based on this handoff, what should be our first priorities and how should we approach this phase?
```

## Mid-Project Team Adjustment

If you discover that different expertise is needed:

```
[Current Persona], I'm finding that we need additional expertise in [area]. Would you recommend bringing in [Specific Persona] at this point? What specific questions or tasks should I focus on with them?
```

## Sample Core Teams by Project Type

These examples illustrate possible team compositions but should not replace the selection process:

### UI-Heavy Application
- Sofia Chen (UX/UI Consultant)
- Alex Harrington (Design-to-Development Bridge)
- Nikolai Koslov (Senior Developer)
- Jamie Taylor (AI Development Expert)

### Data-Driven Application
- Dr. Arya Chen (Tech Stack Advisor)
- Raj Patel (Data Engineer)
- Nikolai Koslov (Senior Developer)
- Daniel Morales (Project Manager)

### Complex Technical Implementation
- Marcus Williams (Technical Architect)
- Nikolai Koslov (Senior Developer)
- Jamie Taylor (AI Development Expert)
- Aisha Johnson (Development Coach)

### Mobile Application
- Elena Rodriguez (Mobile App Specialist)
- Sofia Chen (UX/UI Consultant)
- Nikolai Koslov (Senior Developer)
- Daniel Morales (Project Manager)

## Remember

- Not all personas need to be involved in every project
- Core team members may change as the project evolves
- Some personas may be consulted briefly for specific decisions rather than serving as core team members
- Document key decisions from each persona to maintain continuity
